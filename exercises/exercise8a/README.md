Add Firebase Authentication service to basic Flutter App. 

Make Email/Password or Google Auth (or both) work on that App.

Pre_request: https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

Step refer: https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#0

## Workspace
```cd flutter-codelabs/firebase-auth-flutterfire-ui/start```
I use start folder to implement my app.

## How to de-configure flutterfire?
Follow the steps from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70844655/how-to-de-configure-flutterfire

## Remember to add import in lib/main.dart file
According to https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios
```
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';
```
Otherwise you will meet error when you build the app.

```
